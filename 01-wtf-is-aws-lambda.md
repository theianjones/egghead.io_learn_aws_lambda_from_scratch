Normally, "serverless with AWS" translates to "AWS Lambda".

Only provide the function.

AWS manages the servers for you. There are servers but they aren't yours.

You only pay for the usage.

But you don't pay straight-away though. You get 1M for free each month and pay \$0.20 for every 1M after that.

Supports:

- .NET
- Go
- Java
- Node
- Python
- Ruby

You can edit your code in a number of ways - including directly in the AWS console or uploading your files as a zip.
