[Video link](https://egghead.io/lessons/aws-use-external-dependencies-in-an-aws-lambda-function?pl=learn-aws-lambda-from-scratch-d29d)

Upload a zipfile to aws to use dependencies in your lambda function.

It must include all the code and our dependencies.

Note that there is a limit of 50MB for direct upload in this way. If the code is too large, you won't be able to edit it in the console.
