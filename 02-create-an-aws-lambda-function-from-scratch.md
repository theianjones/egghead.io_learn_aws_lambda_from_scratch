# Create an AWS Lambda function from scratch

Search for Lambda in the [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com), creating an account if you don't already have one. This is a great autocomplete and once you've found the service once it will be visible without searching when you login next.

Lambda isn't a global service. Pick one closest to your users. Only two AWS regions currently don't offer Lambda functions (Osaka and Capetown) - you'll need to select best fit for users in those regions.

You can set up tests with custom data that you can run from the console at any point when testing new functionality doesn't cause regression problems.
